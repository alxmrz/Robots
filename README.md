# Robots
Robot's city...will be in the future :)  
Now it is only orcs and humans mode xD  


Download the code and run *dist/index.html* to watch it in action or run command '$ webpack' in root directory  to compile the code to dist/ folder.
Also you can watch the demo here: http://i98535xh.bget.ru/robots/ (not always current version of the code)

Notice! Unittests does not work because of a remaking code structure. Must be fixed later.

1) npm install
2) npm run build
3) Open dist/index.html
